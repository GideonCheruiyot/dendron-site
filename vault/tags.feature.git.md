Anything to do with notes getting sync'd with Git local or remote vaults. 



## Examples
- Vault not syncing to Github
- How can a vault be sync'd to my phone? 
- Common merge conflicts between team members. 
- Workspace add and commit

## Anti-examples
- Service errors with Github (point to Github auth troubleshooting)
