- enhance(publish): faster first load by reducing size of the tree menu (#2379) 
- enhance(views): faster loading of markdown due to parsing improvements (#2505) 

## Everything Else
- fix(publish): properly render mermaid and katex when published
- fix(lookup): add selection2link button for CreateScratchNoteCommand
- fix(pods): fix issue with url links not showing up when using markdown export inside a note reference
- fix(vaults): sometimes see same vault multiple times in vault dropdown
- fix(internal): some edge cases when deleting a note that interferred with tree view and refactoring
- fix(cli): add omitted migration entries
