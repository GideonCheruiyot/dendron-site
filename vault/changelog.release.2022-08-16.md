### Starboard and TIL Highlights

> These are highlights from the [[Dendron Discord|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.discord.channels]] `#starboard` and `#today-i-learned` channels.

- ‚≠ê `Tanamr#3739` shared a workflow tip that tags like #todo are better placed at the end of a line than at the beginning. This is because when you go to [[tags.todo]] and open the backlinks pane, it shows a preview of every line where the tag is mentioned, but only up to where the #todo occurs.
