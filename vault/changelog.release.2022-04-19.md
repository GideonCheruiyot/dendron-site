Dendron 0.91 has sprouted  ðŸŒ±

**Meeting Notes**: We're introducing a new type of special note: **meeting notes**. Meeting notes help you quickly create meeting-specific notes by applying a customizable template. Try them out with the `Dendron: Create Meeting Note` command!

- More information [[in our documentation on special notes|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.special-notes#meeting-note]]

**Note Title Configuration**: This release introduces a configuration setting to allow notes to display their full hierarchy in their note title. For example, if this setting is enabled, a new note named `one.two.three` will be titled  `One Two Three`.

- More information [[in our documentation on workspace configuration|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.ref.config.workspace#enablefullhierarchynotetitle]]

**Opening Assets**: We've expanded functionality for file assets in Dendron. For wikilinks that link to non-note files, `Dendron: Go to Note` and `Go to Definition` will now open them using your OS default app.


## Highlights
- feat(workspace): Meeting Notes 
- feat(workspace): option to gen title using full hierarchy 
- enhance(navigation): `Dendron: Go to Note` and `Go to Definition` support assets in wikilinks

## Everything Else
- feat(cli): Add rename functionality to CLI
- enhance(workspace): workspace vault support for self contained vaults
- fix(airtable): Exporting to airtable automatically saves current document
- fix(publish): add luxon as dev dependency
- fix(workspace): Dendron causes errors in non-Dendron workspaces
- fix(vaults): self contained vaults sync
- fix(view): support custom styles for Note Graph
- fix(view): apply current theme when vscode reduce motion setting is on
