Notes around questions asked during office hours

Xanaus#9249 - How can one export the notes the way we see in the preview? like in pdf format

> We recommend using pandoc to convert markdown to pdf, but publishing to pdf natively is something we are looking into

rlh1994#9754 - Did something change with importing markdown? We had to rollback

> We'll look into it, importing from markdown, Obsidian etc. is on our roadmap for this month
