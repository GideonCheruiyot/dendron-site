**Task Note Status:** Wait, did I finish that task? Dendron now displays task status information in the preview as well as when publishing.

**Handlebar Templates:** Get a handle on templates - Dendron now supports [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/), a minimal templating language that lets you create flexible templates!

**Clean up your published sidebarn:** It's not too late for spring cleaning! You can now configure whether or not a published note should show it's children in the tree view.
