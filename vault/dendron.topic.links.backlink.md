## Summary

## Features

### Linked Backlink
`Linked` backlinks are regular [[wiki links|dendron.topic.links#wiki-links]] that are pointing to the current note.

- NOTE: The link candidate feature of the backlinks panel is currently disabled by default. 'Accessing the Backlinks view' section below goes over how to enable it.

### Candidate Backlink
`Candidate` backlinks are plain text words that match the name of the current note, which can potentially be converted into a (linked) backlink.
