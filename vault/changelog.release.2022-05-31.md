Dendron 0.97 has sprouted üå±

**Task Note Status:** Wait, did I finish that task? Dendron now displays task status information in the preview as well as when publishing.

**Handlebar Templates:** Get a handle on templates - Dendron now supports [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/), a minimal templating language that lets you create flexible templates!

**Clean up your published sidebarn:** It's not too late for spring cleaning! You can now configure whether or not a published note should show it's children in the tree view.

## Highlights
- feat(markdown): handlebar based templates
- feat(views): display task note status when linking to task notes in publishing and in preview
- feat(publish): ability to exclude children in dendron side nav

## Everything Else
- feat(edit): add command to apply a template

- fix(publish): publishing to respect enableHierarchyDisplay
- fix(publish): assetsPrefix breaks images
- fix(publish): "edit this page on ..." link uses the wrong path for self contained vaults
- fix(workspace): Help and Feedback Panel not empty outside of dendron ws
