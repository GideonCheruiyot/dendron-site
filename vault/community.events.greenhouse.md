## Summary

In **Greenhouse talks**, Dendron community members share the fruits of their learning. This may include showcasing workflows, tooling setups, systems, and other topics in personal knowledge management, but also anything that the speaker has in-depth knowledge of that may be of interest to the wider community.  ^Ddu3OTwrJYvI

All talks are recorded and made available on YouTube after the fact.
