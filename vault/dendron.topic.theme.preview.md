Dendron's [[Preview|dendron.ref.commands#show-preview]] will automatically
change it's appearance based on the current VSCode theme: If you are using a
dark theme in VSCode, the preview will also use a dark theme, and same for light
themes. You can also override the theme selection, or apply a custom theme!

## Getting started
