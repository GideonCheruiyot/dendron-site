_Notes around questions asked during office hours_
1. @Xanaus#9249: How can one export the notes the way we see in the preview? like in pdf format?Ans: We currently do not support it. We suggest that you use Pandoc, which is a universal program that can convert between any formats. So you can take markdown converted into PDF or HTML or whatever you want.
