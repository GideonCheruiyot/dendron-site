First, a disclaimer. If you're like me, self promotion might not come easy or conjure up an association with snake oil salesmen.

While this certainly exists, when done responsibly, promotion, or sales, is really about connecting your work with people that stand to benefit from it. 

Towards this end, double shipping is a useful technique in achieving this end.

As a bonus, if you adopt a zettelkasten like workflow, double-shipping becomes easier the more you write.  Not only is this a useful way of recalling related areas of interest for yourself, its also an effective way of spreading the word outwards to other people.
