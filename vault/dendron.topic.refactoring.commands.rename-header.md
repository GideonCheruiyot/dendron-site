## Details

**{{fm.title}}** is a command that lets you select a header and rename it. All wikilinks pointing to this header will be automatically update to the new header.

When selecting the header, you must put the caret on the header you want to rename.

Having the cursor within a header will also show a lightbulb for the [[Contextual UI Header Operations|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.ref.commands#header-operations]], which includes a quick fix item call `Rename Header`
