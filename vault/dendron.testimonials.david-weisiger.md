> I genuinely feel like my team/company is starting to get the best docs in the world. This would not have been possible without dendron. Thank you so much to entire team and community!!! I just want to say that its really given me a lot of passion and joy in developing our published site internal to the company, and is miles and leaps better than confluence or any other experience.
