Having been a college journalist as well as a [podcast host](https://folkstories.org/) in a past life, I've learned to appreciate the value of good questions. 

Answers, while useful, are like a butterfly that's been pinned to the wall - they represent a truth frozen at a particular point in time. While sometimes beautiful to look at, they quickly lose relevance and become outdated.

Good questions are not a fixed constant in space time but rather something that arises from the context of the situation and the people involved. Questions are an invitation to explore. To broaden. To gain a mutual understanding, both of the subject matter, and of the humans involved.
