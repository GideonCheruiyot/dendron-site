### Working with Multiple Columns

VS Code lets you create multiple columns of your editor and arrange them any way you want them.

### Expanding the Current Editor

You can use the `toggleEditorWidth` command with a hotkey to quickly expand the current editor.

```json
{
    "command": "workbench.action.toggleEditorWidths",
    "key": "ctrl+cmd+m"
}
```
