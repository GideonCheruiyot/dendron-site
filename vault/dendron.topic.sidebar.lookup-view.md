## Summary

- status: #stage.germ
- NOTE: this is only for Mac & Windows at this time

This view lets you see the status of the lookup operation that is being done.
When you use `Dendron: Lookup Note`, you will notice that a view called `Lookup View` will appear along with the lookup bar if you have the side bar opened. This view will disappear once the lookup has been confirmed or cancelled.

## Quickstart

The view will provide you with a form that shows the current state of [[lookup modifiers|dendron.topic.lookup.modifiers]], which you can also control within the view.

The changes in the lookup view will also be synced to the modifier buttons on the lookup bar and vice-versa.

- Hovering over the question mark next to each form will show you the description of that form
- Hovering over the form item will show you a description of the functionality of each item.
- Clicking on the X icon that appears when you hover over a text form will remove the currently set modifier that form displays.

### Selection
This lets you view and select what the [[selection type|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.lookup.modifiers#selectiontype]] should be for the currently active note lookup. 

### Effect type
This lets you view and select what the [[effect type|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.lookup.modifiers#effecttype]] should be for the currently active note lookup.

Note that in this form you can select multiple items, and clicking on individual items will add / remove accordingly. Clicking on the X icon that appears when you hover over this form will remove all set effect types.

### Split Horizontally
This switch lets you toggle the [[horizontal|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.lookup.modifiers#horizontal]] split behavior for the currently active note lookup.

### Apply Direct Child Filter
This switch lets you toggle the [[direct child only|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.lookup.modifiers#directchildonly]] filter behavior for the currently active note lookup.
