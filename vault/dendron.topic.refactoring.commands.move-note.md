> Dendron will not allow you to move a note if a note already exists in the destination.

> If you are looking to move a note within a hierarchy in one vault, or simply rename the note, use [[dendron.topic.refactoring.commands.rename-note]] instead.

## Details

**{{fm.title}}** is a command that lets you move a note between vaults when in a [[Multi-vault|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.multi-vault]] workspace, and will also update all references in other notes of that note.

## Moving a note using the file explorer
You can also select **{{fm.title}}** after right clicking on a note in the explorer to move that note. This will also update the backlinks as well.
