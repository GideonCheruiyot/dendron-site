Dendron 0.93 has sprouted  ðŸŒ±

**Dendron Side Bar:** You might notice something new in the Activity Bar in VSCode...Dendron now has its own Side Bar! Your Dendron views (the Tree View, Backlinks, Calendar View, Lookup View) will now show up in their own view container in the Side Bar. If you like things the way they are, dont fear! You can still drag them anywhere you want in your side panels. 

- More information: [[Dendron View|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.concepts.dendron-view]]

**Tip of the Day View:** Along with a new Side Bar, we are also releasing a new `Tip of the Day` view, which will show a rotating tip to help you get the most out of Dendron. 

### Breaking changes
**Tree View:** This release removes web view version of tree view, as well as the [[enableWebUI|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.ref.config#enableWebUI]] feature flag. This release also contains a number of fixes to improve the stability of the tree view.
