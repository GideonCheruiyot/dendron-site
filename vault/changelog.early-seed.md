> This page documents the features, enhancements, and fixes in the latest early seed release. The early seed is a preview of the weekly release, so you'll see the next minor version when installing (ex. `0.78.0` instead of `0.77.1`). When dendron ships the general release, the currently installed extension will automatically be updated (but will still have same version).
