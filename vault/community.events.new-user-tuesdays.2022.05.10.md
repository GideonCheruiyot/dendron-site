### Notes

For this New User Tuesdays, we're just here to answer any questions you might have and also to go over new features and common features for using Dendron. 

- **Task management** is one of the most used things inside of Dendron and it's definitely an area that we are focused on improving.

#### Q&A

- For questions, please add your @{discord-handle}: question
- @kevins8: how do I ask questions on the google doc? (example)

1. @anonrunner#6840: 	I have a note, where Preview is not generated. When I re-open preview, I only see "Loading...". When I click other notes - preview is rendered quickly. This note doesn't look different from other notes I have in the same category. How can I troubleshoot what's wrong there?

_Ans: Possible that this is due to a bad frontmatter. The way of troubleshooting Dendron has a diagnostics report command that if you run that it opens up a new buffer with the last 100 lines of logs in your settings. This is something that you could either have put into your GitHub issue or sent to our team member and we can take a look._

_Here’s the troubleshooting section which you can refer to:__[https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/a6c03f9b-8959-4d67-8394-4d204ab69bfe](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/a6c03f9b-8959-4d67-8394-4d204ab69bfe)_
