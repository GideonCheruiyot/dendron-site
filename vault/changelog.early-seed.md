> This page documents the features, enhancements, and fixes in the latest early seed release. The early seed is a preview of the weekly release, so you'll see the next minor version when installing (ex. `0.78.0` instead of `0.77.1`). When dendron ships the general release, the currently installed extension will automatically be updated (but will still have same version).

## 0.97.0

Dendron 0.97 has sprouted ðŸŒ±


**Task Note Status:** Wait, did I finish that task? Dendron now displays the status of a linked task note in preview and on published pages so you are always up-to-date with your tasks. 

**Handlebar Templates:** Dendron adds a powerful tool for templating: [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/), enabling you to use variables, conditionals, for loops and more in your notes. 

**Publishing Configuration**: This release also extends your ability to customize the Side Nav of your published notes. You can now configure whether or not a published note should show it's children in the tree view, allowing you to prevent overcrowding or undesired navigational destinations.
